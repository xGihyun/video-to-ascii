# Video to ASCII

A fun little project with Zig. 

I initially created this project for fun to play [Bad Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8) on the terminal. 
This type of project has already been done by a lot of other people, but it feels different when you play it with the code you wrote yourself.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is unpolished (i.e., hard coded values).

### Prerequisites

- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for extracting video frames and audio.
- [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) for playing the audio.
